            <p class="lb_text">
                Before Samurai disbanded in 2008, lead singer Johnny Silverhand was a well-known rockerboy. He was a former soldier who battled the corrupted NUSA government and megacorporations, but he was also a recognised manipulator, irrational, and impulsive person. He was murdered by Adam Smasher in 2023's Night City Holocaust, but his conscience was encoded into the Relic before his physical functions stopped.

                                Senior operations manager for Militech was Meredith Stout.  In 2077, a Militech convoy was hijacked by the Maelstrom gang as a result of a company leak. The corporation, suspecting inside information, tasked Meredith with locating the leak. Soon after, she discovered evidence that pointed to her main suspect, Anthony Gilchrist, who was swiftly apprehended and questioned by her team. Meredith, however, was not provided with sufficient information or proof. She started desperately searching Watson for any leads as her job and life were on the line.
